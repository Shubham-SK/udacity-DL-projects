# udacity-DL-projects
My projects from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
- bike sharing // simple feed forward neural network that optimizes the number of bikes a bike rental service business should have in stock based on several data points ranging from weather to demand.
- dog project // covolutional neural network that determines the breed of a dog when given an image.
- tv script generation // recurrent neural network that generates new tv scripts after learning about them with a script dataset.
